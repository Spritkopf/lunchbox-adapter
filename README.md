# Introduction

This is my interpretation of the "BrotboxErsatzPlatine" instrument adapter for the BMW K100. It is based on the circuit originally created by Maru (maru-labs.com).
It purpose is to replace the original instrument unit of the BMW K100 (affectionately called 'lunchbox' because of its distinctive shape) with 3rd party speedometer units. For more information have a look at maru-labs.com.

This project consists of the KiCAD design files for the schematic and PCB
